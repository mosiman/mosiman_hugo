Today is the birthday of my sourdough starter, Melbert. What kind of name is that? I'm not sure.

Around this time a year ago (probably a bit earlier, as I tend to be late to the party) most of my bubble of the internet seemed to be obsessed with baking bread. I quite like the idea of creating something so awesome from so little. But finding flour was a struggle, and yeast was basically nonexistent. Naturally, the solution is to make your own yeast. And so begins the life of Melbert.

### Birth

Melbert had a lot of trouble getting going. If I remember correctly, it took around two weeks before I saw my starter behaving properly (doubling in volume some hours after feeding). This was a tough time! I thought about starting over again many times. Maybe I should have? The main takeaway from this phase of Melbert's life is that bleached flour sucks. I didn't really see much progress until miraculously finding a small bag of whole wheat organic flour at Walmart. I can't really say that it was the persistence that paid off, it's entirely possible that Melbert would never have started going if I had never switched to whole wheat flour.

(April 24 -- there's some activity... is it yeast? shrug emoji)

(April 29 -- More activity, some rising)

(May 1 -- A fairly significant rise! + float test)


### First loaf

The first loaf was not best bro. 

(May 2nd) it was flat as hell. Big sad.

### Second loaf

(may 10)

The second loaf was a bit less flat, but still not really best bro.

### ??? Loaf

Eventually I got the loaf to rise, somewhat (June 21)

### A new recipe

I forgot what the old recipe was, but I now stand firmly behind the following recipe (Artisan sourdough bread all purpose flour). In my idiocy I subbed regular all purpose (bleached, if that matters) flour for bread flour. This recipe had a ratio that led to MUCH better results.

(Sept 18, sourdough bread with home grown tomatoes BLT. Yeah, something softer probably would have been better). 

(March 3, 2021 -- using bread flour and a different recipe)

Now I have full confidence in my sourdough starter. It's actually pretty easy to do! Unless you don't have a dutch oven, in which case it is a huge pain in the ass.

### Poor man's dutch oven

(July 11)

Setup consists of preheating the following all at once:

- Pan of water just below an aluminum pan (bread goes here) and a big ass pot ("traps" the steam from the bread and pan underneath)

I would not recommend. But it more or less works!
