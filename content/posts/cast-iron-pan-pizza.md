Today I made cast iron pan pizza, recipe is thanks to [Adam Ragusea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYxB4QBlrx4). What I love most about Adam Ragusea's videos is the relative lack of precise measurements. Rather, he focuses on ballpark measurements and tells you different cues you can use to determine if you're in the right spot (more or less). 

I had originally wanted to make the pan pizza from [Ethan Chlebowski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhMhYKSMWIY), but I'm not bougie enough to use 8g of yeast. Who knows when the pandemic will bring about another yeast shortage? (I am part of the problem). 

I let the dough rest in the fridge from early Sunday afternoon to Monday evening. I seasoned the pan, not the pizza, and tried my best to stretch the dough over as much of the pan as possible. The dough was still cold, and was hard to stretch. While letting it "proof" (I have a feeling it didn't proof much) for 30 minutes, the dough became easier to work with. I pushed the dough outwards a few times during the proofing stage, and it more or less covered the pan by the 30 minute mark. 

I let the bottom brown too much (i.e. I burnt it), but made sure to keep a very close eye while it was under the broiler. All in all, it turned out better than I expected for my first try. 

The sauce leaves much to be desired (No Name's crushed tomatoes) and I accidentally poured too much garlic powder in... but it still turned out fine. I only used half the dough, so I'll probably get to try again later this week. 

No pictures while it was actually cooking, I only had the idea to put food stuffs on my blog after the fact. Hopefully, more food posts to come!
