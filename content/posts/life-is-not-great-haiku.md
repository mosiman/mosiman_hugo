In grade school they tell you about the structure of a Haiku. It's fun to fit something within the structure, but my teacher at the time told me it was supposed to evoke some particular emotion. Child Dillon was very confused. But if this doesn't sum up the emotions of my life, nothing else will.

Actual original content, by me, when driving with my partner to their parents' place in Cornwall ON. I'm surprised I still remember it after so much time has passed since its inception, but that's a testament to how much its impacted me (I have the memory of a goldfish).
