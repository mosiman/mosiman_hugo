## Beginnings

- My dad was into it
- Built a bike with him when I was 14

{{% note %}}
Also lots of riding with the family as a kid, but I was never really into it until I was old enough and had a bike to be more independent.

## City of Toronto

- Lots of odds and ends
- No car!!!! (dun dun dunnnnn)
- TTC is üí©

{{% note %}}

Things I did:
archery instructor
soccer instructor
wading pool attendant
lifeguard

- TTC is not reliable. Traffic, crazy people, etc. Same with driving.

you think road bikes are bad, but what the hell is this? wood on road + tiny balance beam for crotch. amazing they could procreate

fun fact, even in 1819 you couldnt bike on the sidewalk (fined two pounds)

you could go way faster on these than previous designs. Sometimes catch your limbs in the wheels or hit a rock, break wrists or "sometimes death" according to wikipedia.

## Track

- go vroom
- inside track (like a running track)
- fixed gear (more later)

---

## Mountain

## Bicycle Anatomy

---

{{< slide background-size="contain" background-image="/images/bridgit-ted-bike/bike_anatomy.jpg" >}}

{{% note %}}

Brakes here are disc brakes.

Used to be used for fat wheel bikes (e.g. mountain) because rim brakes were too weak. Decent disc brakes use hydraulics.

Good wet weather performance (idk why though), easy to maintain pressure. Better sensitivity.

Heavier than rim brakes usually, can be more difficult to maintain.

Pay attention to frame geometry. E.g., fork rake for steering sensitivity and wheel distance for power transfer, etc.

# Bicycle commuting

## How to not die

---

### Faster is better than slower

- Reduces relative speed between you and big fast metal box
- still slow tho, so stay to the right when possible

---

### Go for predictability

<img src="/images/bridgit-ted-bike/bike_predictable.png">

{{% note %}}

this also means taking the entire lane if you have to. 
E.g. construction reduces the lane size. Don't risk the possibility of some mans thinking his meeting is more important than possibly your life.

{{% /note %}}

---

### Still a vehicle

- Bicycles on the road are considered vehicles!
- Follow driving rules, basically. 

{{% note %}}
Driving rules e.g.
Red lights
4 way stops
signal
have lights and stuff
don't be dumb
{{% /note %}}

### General safety

- Helmets to protect soft squishy brain
- Would advise no earbuds
    - Tesla's are scarily quiet

---


## How to not be an asshole

- Don't run over pedestrians (i.e., bike on sidewalk)

---

## Can't always do both

- e.g., taking up the whole lane

---

## Little known road rules

- Dotted vs solid bike lane lines
- One meter of space

---

## Plan your gear


--- 

## Plan your route


---

### Major KW bike routes
