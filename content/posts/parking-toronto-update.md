title: 'Toronto parking ticket visualizer live again'

I finally went ahead and redid my website with a static site generator, since I don't really have much dynamic content. But I did have the Toronto parking ticket visualizer, so I built an entire backend with Django. There was a lot I didn't understand, but it felt a bit bloated, so I scrapped it. The switch to Hugo was relatively painless, but having decided to redo my parking ticket API in .NET Core (no previous experience!), it took a while. Alas, it is more or less done and the web app should work as it always has. I implore you to [check it out](http://mosiman.ca/parkingtoronto) :)

Cheers,
