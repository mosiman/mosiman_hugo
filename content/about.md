{{< figure src="/images/me.jpg"  >}}

I'm Dillon, a student at the University of Waterloo studying mathematics with a focus on scientific computing. I program primarily with Python in all sorts of settings: scientific, data analytics, and web programming. I've recently taken a liking to Julia as an alternative to C++ for heavy computations. When I'm not programming, I like to hit the gym, ride my bike, and play music. If you like the work I do and are looking to get a job done right, feel free to get in touch!
