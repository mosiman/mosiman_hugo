{{< figure src="/images/me.jpg"  >}}

I'm Dillon. I'm a recent University of Waterloo grad. I studied Applied Mathematics with a focus on scientific computing. I somehow managed to pick up minors in statistics and computer science along the way. Currently I work at [Bridgit](https://www.bridgitsolutions.com) as a Junior Devops Engineer.

I have recently taken a liking to Golang due to its concurrency model and the static binaries. I also like to work things out in Julia because of it's mathematically inclined ecosystem and _beautiful_ syntax. I can also get by in Python and C#. I hope to acquire a functional language for the toolbox in the near future.

I am currently obsessed with
- Backpacks (I have a Peloton Asphalt from [Life Behind Bars](https://lbbjkt.com/) and it's freaking amazing)
- Terminal applications. `nvim` is the most used, but I also love little standalone ones like `wuzz`, `lazygit`, `lazydocker`, and `k9s`.
- My old Thinkpad X230 which I hope never dies on me. The ever increasing resource requirements of the web are stacking the odds against me.
