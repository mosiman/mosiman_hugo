Analysis was done in Julia, and visualization and interactivity with <a href=https://leafletjs.com/>Leaflet.js</a>. Users can view parking ticket data by finding and clicking on a street.

Note: Currently unavailable while I undergo site renovations.

Tools: Julia, Javascript with Leaflet.js, and Python with Django.[^1]
